User Interface Library version 0.7April 5th, 1996Copyright © 1995, 1996 Adam Alpernaalpern@hampshire.edu[ABOUT BLURB HERE];;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;INSTALLATION AND LOADINGIf you are using MK defsystem, edit the pathnames in ui-lib.system and placeit in your *central-registry* directory.If you are not using defsystem, edit the value of the parameter *ui-lib-source-dir* in load-ui-lib.lisp and load the file.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;TO-DO¥ add explicit code to draw in different BIT-DEPTHS (currently looks  bad below 8 bit, and horrid in B&W. Unfortunately, I don't have access  to a Mac that can display below 8 bit (PowerMac video is weird))¥ CLEAN UP. The code has grown piece-meal, as I needed features, and is   pretty messy. The complete re-write I want to do will probably break  some code. Probably for version 1.0¥ fix weird behavior of LINE-DIALOG-ITEM classes when dragging from IFT palette¥ fix TITLE-BOX-DIALOG-ITEM flaming death (still doesn't happen on my machine)¥ DOCUMENTATION!!!¥ ICON-POPUP-MENU, ICON-SEQUENCE-DIALOG-ITEM;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;WHERE TO GET ITThe UI-Lib homepage is at:http://hampshire.edu/~adaF92/MCL/UI-Lib.htmlThe latest version is always at:http://hampshire.edu/~adaF92/MCL/dist/ui-lib-latest.sit.hqxAnd, of course, fromftp://ftp.digitool.com/pub/mcl/contrib/;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;REVISION HISTORY¥ v0.7.1, 4/17/96	- added better default-button outline drawing for 3d-button-dialog-item.	  draws a default outline with a 3d-effect (sort of like ~Aaron)	  Looks best of square, non-inset buttons. Still needs tweaking	  for round-rect 3d buttons.	- added embossing to draw-centered-text function. Takes 2 keywords:	  emboss, a boolean, and emboss-color, defaults to *white-color*	- fixed eval-when typo in system-75-windoid.lisp	- copied contents of ui-lib-ift.lisp into a new file - seems	  the resource fork (where FRED stores font info) was hopelessly	  corrupted.	- changed overlooked compile-if-changed in load-ui-lib.lisp to	  ui-compile-if-changed¥ v0.7, 4/5/96		- provided load-ui-lib.lisp for people who aren't using defsystem.	- lots of little bug fixes. Can't remember what they all are.	- many views with external 3d borders now get colors from their window, if	  that window is a 3d-window. Looks much cleaner.	- added alt-3d-pop-up-menu to 3D-pop-up-menu.lisp, which provides a	  Coplad-esque alternative look to popup menus (like the Aaron extension).	- removed sound.lisp	- removed font-picker.lisp	- line-dialog-item.lisp merged into dialog-items.lisp	- moved CHANGES into this file (README)¥ v0.6.6 11/10/95 - bug fix release	- fixed CCL-3 conditional in 3D-pop-up-menu.lisp (it was CCL3 - oops!)¥ v0.6.5 11/10/95	- added progress-indicator.lisp, which defines bar-progress-indicator	  and arc-progress-indicator. If you've seen Fetch 3.0b6 you'll be	  familiar with the arc-progress-indicator, and of course, everyone	  should know bar-progress-indicator from the Finder.	- cleaned up ui-lib-ift.lisp a lot.¥ v0.6, 10/3/95. Lot's of changes	- removed canned-dlogs.lisp	- No more resource file. canned-dlogs was the only file that needed 	  anything from the resource file.	- included the file ui-lib-ift.lisp in the distribution, which adds support 	  for the various items defined in UI-Lib to Interface Tools.	- Lots 3D-look interface stuff.	- added file 3D-pop-up-menu.lisp. Defines a class, 3D-pop-up-menu. Also	  patches the MCL 2.0.1 pop-up-menu view-draw-contents method to properly 	  draw the drop-shadow.	- added support for MCL 3.0.¥ v0.5.2, 5/1/95	- Added file U3DDrawing.lisp, which contains color constants	  for miscellaneous greys from U3DDrawing.h. Eventually I'll port	  the C++ (ick) 3d drawing code over to MCL/CLOS.	  File:		U3DDrawing.h	  Contains:	Headers for 3D drawing routines.	  Written by:	Jamie Osborne, Robin Mair, Faulkner White, Henri Lamiraux	  Copyright:	© 1992-1993 by Apple Computer, Inc.	- Added ICON-WIDTH, ICON-HEIGHT, ICON-DEPTH by Alex Repenning 	  <ralex@cs.colorado.edu> to rsrc.lisp, but changed the ICON-  	  prefix to CICN- for clarity and so they don't conflict with 	  the icon-size accessor method for cicn-dialog-item-mixin.	- cicn-dialog-item-mixin has been enhanced to figure out its	  icon's size with these if it has not been provided as an	  argument to make-instance.¥ v0.5.1, 4/30/95	- Added the file oodles.lisp, which contains code from Mark Tapia's 	  Oodles of Utils for doing 3d framing effects. Adds the folllowing dialog 	  items: editable-text-dialog-Item-3d, table-dialog-item-3d, 	  editable-number-dialog-Item-3d.¥ v0.5, 4/29/95	- First public release.
